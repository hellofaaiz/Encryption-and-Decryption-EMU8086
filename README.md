# Encryption-and-Decryption-EMU8086
This project implements a Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm on the 8086 microprocessor, using the EMU8086 emulator. It showcases how basic cryptographic techniques can be effectively executed on resource-constrained hardware.
#Features
    Encryption:
    Converts plaintext into ciphertext by shifting characters based on a user-defined key.
    Decryption:
    Restores ciphertext to plaintext using the same key.
    Character Handling:
    Supports uppercase and lowercase letters while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.
    Interactive Interface:
    Prompts users to input text and select between encryption or decryption operations.
